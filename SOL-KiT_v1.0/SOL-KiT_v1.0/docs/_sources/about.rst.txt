About SOL-KiT
=============

**SOL-KiT** (**S**\crape-**O**\ff-**L**\ayer **Ki**\netic **T**\ransport) is a fully implicit 1D code with kinetic (or fluid) electrons, fluid (or stationary) ions, and diffusive neutrals. The code is designed for fundamental exploration of non-local physics in the SOL and utilizes an arbitrary degree Legendre polynomial decomposition of the electron distribution function, treating both electron-ion and electron-atom collisions.

The code is being
developed as a PhD project at Imperial College London and in collaboration with the
Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. It is written in Fortran 90.
