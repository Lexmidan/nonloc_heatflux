This test is a partial version of Run 10 in the manuscript, where the simulation is run only up to the first plotted timestep. This is timestep number 664, and when density and temperature are plotted against X_GRID.txt, the obtained graph (zoomed in on first half of domain) should correspond to the orange dashed line in Figure 8 in the manuscript. Recommended number of processes: 16-32
