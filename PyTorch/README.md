# This folder contains the key files for solving the non-local transport problem
# TODO:
- [ ] With change of step in `generate_QimpactTrainingData.py`  the length of input vector for NN also changes. Automate the calculation of used features (thus also the length) in `NN_training.py`, `heatConduction.py` and `NN_training.py`
- [ ] Scaling of `x` in  `generate_QimpactTrainingData.py` ???

## Generate the data neseccary for neural network to train
We used local data that has been generate via `python3 generate_QimpactTrainingData.py 100 0.01 0.2 40000 105`

However, I forgot to include these data to `gitignore.git` and have accidentally uploaded them to this repository

`NN-heatflux.ipynb` and `NN_training.py` contain training part of the neural network, whereas `HeatFluxModel.py` and `HeatFluxData.py` contain the definiotion of the NN itself and data preparation respectevely

# Time evolution of the nonlocal problem 
The script responsible for time evolution problem can be reached either via 'time-evolv-heatflux.ipynb' notebook, or can be started directly by running `parameter.py` file

All parameters of the problem, such as number of used profiles points, boundary conditions, definition of parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, number of timesteps and its magnitude $dt$ are contained and may be modified in `parameter.py` file.

`heatConduction.py` package contains necessary components to solve the PDEs such as calculations of jacobians, Newton iterations, second order derivatives, etc.
`postprocessing.py` package is responsible for visualization of the results.

The structure of the modules solving the time evolution of temperature distribution (`heatConduction.py`, `postprocessing.py`,  `parameter.py`)  are based on github heatConduction repository published by https://github.com/rickfu415
